# TeleComPulse
Solved a business problem of high customer churn rates in the telecom industry using Python and Machine Learning.

## Customer Churn Analysis Approach

Customer churn analysis in the telecommunications industry involves leveraging data, analytics, and algorithms to understand and predict customer attrition (churn) with the objective of reducing it. At TeleComPulse, we follow a structured approach outlined below:

### 1. Data Preparation:

- **Gathering and Preprocessing the Data:** Collect relevant data from various sources such as customer databases, billing systems, and datasets available from platforms like Kaggle.
  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, outliers, and data quality issues to ensure the integrity and reliability of the data.

### 2. Feature Selection and Engineering:

- **Identify Relevant Features:** Determine important features including customer demographics, usage patterns, contract details, and customer service interactions.
  
- **Create New Features:** Engineer new features such as calculating customer tenure, contract variables, average usage, or recent complaints to enrich the dataset.

### 3. Data Splitting:

- **Split the Data:** Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. A typical split might be 70% for training, 20% for validation, and 10% for testing to independently train and evaluate the model's performance.

### 4. Model Selection:

We employ the following machine learning algorithms for churn prediction:

- **Logistic Regression:** A simple yet effective model for binary classification.
  
- **Decision Trees and Random Forests:** Effective for capturing complex relationships in the data.
  
- **Gradient Boosting:** Provides high predictive accuracy.
  
- **Neural Networks:** Suitable for handling large and complex datasets.

### 5. Model Training:

- **Train the Models:** Train the selected models on the training dataset using appropriate hyperparameters.
  
- **Evaluate the Models:** Assess the models' performance on the validation dataset using relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 6. Model Evaluation:

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tune the models' hyperparameters to optimize performance.
  
- **Evaluate on Test Dataset:** Assess the final model's performance on the test dataset, which it hasn't encountered during training or validation.
  
- **Calculate Final Metrics:** Determine the model's effectiveness in predicting churn using final evaluation metrics.

### 7. Monitoring and Maintenance:

- **Continuous Monitoring:** Monitor the model's performance over time to ensure its effectiveness.
  
- **Periodic Retraining:** Retrain the model periodically with updated data to keep it relevant as customer behaviors evolve.

This cyclical process aims to reduce churn, enhance customer retention, and optimize revenue through data-driven decision-making and continuous refinement.
